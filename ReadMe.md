## About: 

This Folder contains the following sections: 
* Section_1_Abalone
* Section_2_Astralia_Rain
* Section_3_Boston  

**Section_1_Abalone contains:** 
* **Abalone_pred_models.ipynb** - the jupyter notebook containing the code and thought process behind approaching this problem. 
* **Data** - a folder which contains the data used for this project. 
* **abalone_box_plt** - a box plot displying the variance in the data. 
* **abalone_feature_plot** - a scatter plot the compares relations across the files. 
* **DecisionTreeRegr_result** - shows the comparisons between what the model predicted vs the ground truth. 
* **multiclass_logreg_result** = shows the comparisons between what the model predicted vs the ground truth. 

**NOTICE:**
I only outputed the output of my models to files for two of the models in this entire assignment. I felt that without exact clarification 
on the standards expected for grading, It may not be necessary to add more steps than needed in building my models. 

**Section_2_Australia_Rain:** 
* **Data** - a folder which contains the data used for this project. 
* **Workbook** - a folder which contains the jupyter notebook of the code and thought process behind approaching this problem. 

**Section_3_Boston:**
* **Data** - a folder which contains the data used for this project. 
* **Workbook** - a folder which contains the jupyter notebook of the code and thought process behind approaching this problem.
